# SAPLING CONTRACT TEMPLATES IN LIGO FOR ANONYMOUS TRANSACTIONS ON TEZOS

This repository contains 3 templates to build privacy-preserving smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

- `sapling-xtz` contains a template contract that allows the anonymous transfer of XTZ (Tezos native token)
- `sapling-fa12` contains a template contract that allows the anonymous transfer of FA1.2 tokens on Tezos (the first standard for fungible tokens)
- `sapling-fa2` contains a template contract that allows the anonymous transfer of FA2 fungible tokens (because FA2 tokens can also be NFTs, it is important to note that Sapling transactions are only relevant for fungible tokens, not NFTs)

> The contracts are written in CameLigo
